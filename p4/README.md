# Save it!

This is an iOS version of a previous Android game I randomly saw on Internet, which is easy to learn and might have the ablity to make people 'addicated'. There is a small organge ball born to drop with gravity, and we can move it by pointing anywhere within game area. And there are other squares appearing to chase it. If the orange ball be caught by them then game is over.

So I tried to implement it in iOS. I used IBAnimatable library for iteraction which I learnt from another git repo and found it is also applicable to my game. But I failed to implement the pop windows for game over view(something wrong with UI alert and action), and I planned to have a back database to record different player's record and everyone can choose their own color of the fighting ball, which are my regrets for this project.

Language: JavaScript

Type: Web-based Animation Game)

Idea:
Shout out to childhood memory **KING OF FIGHTERS**, I am going to write a Web-based JavaScript Fighter Game.

I would find some authorized classical fighter images, then implement the figure movement operations through keyboard input. Considering my ability and the timeline, I prefer using JavaScript for this game. The ideal production should be a moblie APP, to accomplish it, I am doing reseach on finding a reliable third-party platform to either convert web APP to mobile APP or build mobile stuff directly. (If this process turns out to be difficult and time comsuming, my production would be a WebApp.)

Challenge: Web End-back
I will try to complete the player log in system and score ranking list.

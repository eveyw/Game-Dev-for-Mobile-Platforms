# KOF

### Language: 
JavaScript

### Type: 
Web-based Animation Game

### Idea:
Shout out to childhood memory **KING OF FIGHTERS**, this is a Web-based JavaScript Fight Game. 
I used SpiritJS library for better appealing animations, and learned how to do code layout through several good examples of KOF. In this project, the difficult part for me is the Computer Player movement function. In the beginning, I tried some AI approaches to control it, but the deployment process was complex. So I simply used loops to repeat fighting movement randomly, which makes this game not that intelligent, but, at least complete.

### Drawbacks: 
No player log in system and database, score ranking list;
Didn't make it a mobile APP.

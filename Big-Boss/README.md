### Language: 
JavaScript

### Type: 
Web-based Animation Game

### Idea:
Shout out to childhood memory **KING OF FIGHTERS**, I am going to write a Web-based JavaScript Fight Game.

I would find some authorized classical fighter images, then implement the figure movement operations through keyboard input. Considering my ability and the timeline, I prefer JavaScript for this game. My ideal production should be a moblie APP, to accomplish it, I am doing reseach on finding a reliable third-party platform to either convert WebApp to mobile APP or build mobile stuff directly. (If this process turns out to be difficult and time comsuming, my production would be a WebApp.)

### Challenge: Web End-back
I will try to establish a player log in system with complete data storehouse, together with a score ranking list.

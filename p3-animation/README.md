#Germ War

This is an animation game based on cocos2d-x and its prototype is Thunder Cross. I changed the UI and background into Germ War, plus different kinds of bullets, enemies and supplies.

When I processed this project, the installation of platform and development environment was my first obstacle, then I spent some time to find out which language fits better. Also, the UI of Android cocos2d game is not that easy, I need to put all items into one png in order that corresponding function can read them.
